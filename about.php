							<h3>The Person Behind Monochromatic Shop</h3>
							<p>Hi there welcome. I'm Sketch Shark, a fantasy maniac who loves magic and "other-worldly" stuff! Dots are amazing and I was captivated by just how much could be achieved by using dots to create artworks. Thus began by journey into creating art through dots.</p>
							<p>I believe in creating artwork that have a deeper meaning that people can relate to,a message (and also stuff that's fun to draw). If you'd see more of my artworks and the other wierd stuff that I do, go ahead and check out my account on Instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sketch_shark/" target="_blank">@sketch_shark</a>.</p>

							<h3>Mission &amp; Vision</h3>
							<p>Monochromatic Shop is a place for black artwork lovers. Our goal with this brand is to provide a deeper sense to all things monochromatic.</p>
							<p>Artworks need not be just for the eyes anymore. Tote-bags need not be bland anymore. This is Monochromatic Shop, artworks that have a deeper symbolism and eco-friendly solutions with a unique tang to them.</p>
